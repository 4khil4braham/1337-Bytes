**Name:** Outlook Web App (OWA) Brute Force Utility\
**Module:** `auxiliary/scanner/http/owa_login`

Basic usage against username list created during the reconnaissance phase. Use  `USER_FILE` to configure the generated username list. This will allow us to brute-force the OWA service for valid usernames.

```
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/http/owa_login
msf auxiliary(owa_login) > show options
    ... show and set options ...
msf auxiliary(owa_login) > run
```

Extract the valid username to a text file and use the following to perform credential stuffing for valid usernames.

```
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/http/owa_ews_login
msf auxiliary(owa_ews_login) > show options
    ... show and set options ...
msf auxiliary(owa_login) > run
```
