# ðŸ”“ Authorization Protocols

Authorization protocols dictate how an entity, typically a user or a process, is granted access to resources and services in a computer system or network. These protocols play a crucial role in ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users or systems can access sensitive data and functionalities. Some of the most prominent authorization protocols include:

1. **OAuth**: OAuth is a widely adopted protocol for authorization. It allows a user's account information to be used by third-party services, such as Facebook or Google, without exposing the user's password. OAuth is commonly used to authorize third-party apps to access user data from a service without giving them full control of the account.
2. **OpenID Connect**: Built on top of OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect is an authentication layer that allows clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server. It's widely used for single sign-on (SSO) services.
3. **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**: SAML is an XML-based framework for communicating user authentication, entitlement, and attribute information. It's commonly used to enable SSO for web applications, allowing users to log in once and gain access to multiple systems.
4. **Kerberos**: A network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for client-server applications using secret-key cryptography. Kerberos is widely used in secure environments and is known for its ability to handle authentication for a large number of requests.
5. **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**: Although primarily a directory service protocol, LDAP is also used for authentication and authorization purposes. It is used in accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over a network.
6. **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)**: A networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service.
7. **XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language)**: A standard for defining access control policies in XML format. XACML describes both a policy language and an access control decision request/response language.
8. **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**: Unlike role-based access control (RBAC), which uses predefined roles, ABAC defines access rights based on attributes (user attributes, resource attributes, and environment conditions).
9. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: A widely used access control mechanism that restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization. In RBAC, roles are assigned permissions, and users or sessions are granted roles.

Each of these protocols has specific use cases and implementation scenarios. The choice of protocol depends on various factors, such as the type of application, security requirements, scalability needs, and the organization's existing technology infrastructure.
