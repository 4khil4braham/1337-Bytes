# üìê Threat Modelling

## Enhanced Overview of Threat Modeling

Threat Modeling is a systematic and structured technique within cybersecurity, focusing on identifying security objectives, threats, and vulnerabilities in applications. This approach aids in making informed design and engineering decisions and prioritizing efforts in designing, developing, and deploying secure applications.

### Challenges in Threat Modeling

1. **Integration with a Mature Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**: Threat modeling requires effective integration with a well-established SDLC.
2. **Time-Intensive Process**: The methodology involves a detailed and thorough analysis, making it time-consuming.
3. **Difficulty in Demonstrating Return on Investment (ROI)**: Quantifying the financial benefits of threat modeling can be challenging.
4. **Perceived Monotony**: The process can be somewhat tedious and less engaging.

### Critical Requirements for Effective Threat Modeling

1. **Mature SDLC Integration**:
   * **Requirement Gathering Phase**: Establishing a robust mechanism for gathering requirements.
   * **Defined Design Phase**: Having a clear and structured design phase in the SDLC.
2. **Comprehensive Understanding of Data Classification**:
   * **Sensitivity Assignment**: Marking data with appropriate sensitivity levels upon creation, modification, deletion, or serialization.
   * **Classification as a Security Measure**: Using classification to determine the extent of control and security needed for the data.
   * **Business Asset Value Indication**: The classification reflects the data's value as a business asset.
   * **Determining Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**:
     * Confidentiality levels are such as public, confidential, or restricted.
     * Integrity levels are categorized as Low, Medium, or High.
     * Availability classifications like Support, Essential, or Critical.
3. **Understanding of Web Application Security Mechanisms**: Gaining knowledge about various security mechanisms specific to web applications.
