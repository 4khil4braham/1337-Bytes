# ðŸ“˜ Threat Modelling Frameworks

Threat modeling frameworks provide structured approaches for identifying and mitigating potential threats to a system. These frameworks are essential in systematically understanding potential security risks and implementing appropriate security measures. Here are some of the most recognized threat modeling frameworks:

1. **STRIDE**: Developed by Microsoft, STRIDE is an acronym for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. It's used to identify potential threats in each category and develop corresponding mitigations.
2. **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**: PASTA is a risk-centric threat modeling framework. It involves seven stages, including defining objectives, analyzing threats, and developing countermeasures based on risk analysis.
3. **Trike**: A risk-based framework that starts with defining the acceptable levels of risk. It then maps out data flows within the application and identifies potential threats, focusing on mitigating risks to an acceptable level.
4. **VAST (Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat modeling)**: VAST is designed to be scalable and integrates with agile development processes. It focuses on a broad view of the entire organizationâ€™s infrastructure and application landscape rather than just individual applications.
5. **OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)**: Primarily used for organizational risk assessment, OCTAVE focuses on identifying and prioritizing risks at the organizational level and developing a strategic security approach.
6. **Attack Trees**: A method for visualizing an attacker's paths to achieve a specific goal. It helps in understanding the potential threats and the likelihood of their success.
7. **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**: Although not a threat modeling framework in the traditional sense, CVSS provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity.
8. **DREAD**: An acronym for Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability. DREAD is used to quantify, compare, and prioritize the amount of risk presented by each evaluated threat.
9. **hTMM (hybrid Threat Modeling Method)**: hTMM is designed to be adaptable to various environments and focuses on both the software and the operational aspects of the system.

Each of these frameworks has its methodologies and focuses, ranging from detailed technical analysis of software to broader organizational risk assessment. The choice of a particular framework often depends on the specific needs and context of the organization, the nature of the system being analyzed, and the expertise of the team conducting the threat modeling.
