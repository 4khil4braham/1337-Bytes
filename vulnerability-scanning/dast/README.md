# ⏹️ DAST

DAST, which stands for Dynamic Application Security Testing, is a method used to detect security vulnerabilities in web applications while running in production. This approach is unique in its ability to test an application from the "outside-in" to find security flaws.

Key features and aspects of DAST include:

1. **Black Box Testing**: DAST is considered a black box testing method, where the testing does not require internal knowledge of the application, such as the source code or architecture.
2. **Real-Time Testing**: It tests the application in its running state, which means it can identify issues that are only evident when it is operational.
3. **Simulation of External Attacks**: DAST tools simulate attacks on an application, mimicking the actions of external malicious attackers. This helps identify vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other standard security threats.
4. **Automated Scanning**: Most DAST tools provide automated scanning capabilities, regularly scanning web applications for vulnerabilities.
5. **Results Interpretation**: The results typically need to be interpreted by security professionals, as DAST can generate false positives and negatives. Understanding the context of the application is crucial for accurate interpretation.
6. **Limited by User Permissions**: Since DAST approaches an application from an external perspective, it can only test the parts of the application that are exposed to users. It might not detect internal security issues that are inaccessible from the outside.
7. **Complement to SAST**: DAST is often used with Static Application Security Testing (SAST), which analyzes source code for vulnerabilities. While SAST is performed early in the development cycle, DAST is usually done later when the application is more complete.
8. **Ease of Integration**: DAST tools can be easily integrated into the software development lifecycle (SDLC), especially in the testing and deployment stages.

By using DAST, organizations can enhance their web application security posture, identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities that attackers could potentially exploit once the application is live.
