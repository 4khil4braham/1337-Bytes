# ðŸ”Ž SAST

SAST, or Static Application Security Testing, is a method of security testing that involves analyzing an application's source code, bytecode, or binary code without executing it. This approach is designed to identify potential security vulnerabilities early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Here are some critical aspects of SAST:

1. **Source Code Analysis**: SAST tools scan the source code to detect security flaws, coding errors, and vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), buffer overflows, and other standard security weaknesses.
2. **White Box Testing Approach**: SAST is often referred to as white box testing because it requires access to the internal structure and workings of the application, including source code, architecture, and dependencies.
3. **Early Detection of Vulnerabilities**: Since SAST is performed early in the SDLC, typically at the coding or testing stages, it helps identify and fix security issues before the application is deployed, reducing the cost and effort of remediation.
4. **Automated Scanning**: Most SAST tools offer automated scanning capabilities, enabling developers to integrate security checks into their regular development processes.
5. **Language-Specific**: Different SAST tools are designed to work with specific programming languages and frameworks, so choosing a tool that aligns with the application's technology stack is essential.
6. **Integrates with Development Environments**: SAST tools can often be integrated into Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines, and version control systems, facilitating a DevSecOps approach.
7. **Focus on Code Quality and Security Standards**: Besides identifying security vulnerabilities, SAST can also enforce coding standards and best practices, contributing to the overall quality of the code.
8. **Limitations**: While SAST effectively identifies specific vulnerabilities, it may not detect runtime or environmental issues. Therefore, it is commonly used with other testing methods like Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).

SAST plays a crucial role in modern secure software development, enabling organizations to address security concerns and build more secure proactively
