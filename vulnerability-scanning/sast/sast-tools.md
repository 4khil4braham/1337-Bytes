# ðŸ›  SAST Tools

Several Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are popular in the software development and cybersecurity industries. These tools help analyze source or binary code to identify potential security vulnerabilities. Some of the most widely used SAST tools include:

1. **Checkmarx**: Known for its comprehensive and accurate code analysis, Checkmarx supports a wide range of programming languages and integrates well with various development environments and DevOps pipelines.
2. **SonarQube**: This tool is popular for continuously inspecting code quality and security. It supports multiple languages and integrates seamlessly with continuous integration tools.
3. **Veracode**: Veracode offers static code analysis as part of its suite of security testing tools. It's recognized for its cloud-based service, making it easily accessible and scalable.
4. **Fortify Static Code Analyzer (by Micro Focus)**: Fortify provides a robust solution for static code analysis, supporting a broad range of programming languages and frameworks, and is known for its detailed vulnerability descriptions and recommendations.
5. **Coverity (by Synopsys)**: Coverity is a comprehensive tool that offers static code analysis to detect software flaws and vulnerabilities. It is well-regarded for its accuracy and integration capabilities.
6. **Klocwork (by Perforce)**: Klocwork is tailored for teams in high-compliance industries. It offers real-time code analysis and is known for its effectiveness in large, complex codebases.
7. **Codacy**: This tool automates code reviews, and monitors code quality, helping teams enforce coding standards and identify security issues.
8. **CodeSonar (by GrammaTech)**: CodeSonar is known for its deep, static analysis capabilities, providing detailed insights into code complexity and potential vulnerabilities.
9. **Snyk**: Primarily known for its focus on open-source vulnerabilities, Snyk also offers SAST capabilities, helping developers identify and fix vulnerabilities in their proprietary code.
10. **JetBrains ReSharper**: While primarily a productivity tool for .NET developers, ReSharper also includes features for code quality analysis, including security vulnerabilities.

Each of these tools has its strengths, such as support for different programming languages, integration with development environments and pipelines, and specific types of vulnerability detection. The choice of a SAST tool often depends on the specific needs of a development project, the programming languages and frameworks in use, and the organization's overall security strategy.
