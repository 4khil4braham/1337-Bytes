# ðŸ›  IAST Tools

Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) tools combine the benefits of static and dynamic analysis to identify vulnerabilities in applications during runtime. These tools are integrated into the application environment and provide real-time feedback. Some popular IAST tools include:

1. **Contrast Security**: Known for its Contrast Assess product, which provides IAST capabilities. It uses instrumentation to monitor and analyze application performance in real-time, identifying security vulnerabilities as they occur.
2. **Veracode**: Offers an IAST solution that integrates with the application runtime environment to identify vulnerabilities during normal application usage. It is known for its ease of use and integration with CI/CD pipelines.
3. **Micro Focus Fortify**: Their IAST solution, part of the Fortify product suite, provides real-time security testing through the instrumentation of the application. It's effective in identifying security vulnerabilities in complex applications.
4. **Synopsys Seeker**: Seeker is an IAST tool that performs interactive security testing of web applications. It provides accurate vulnerability detection with line-of-code visibility and is designed to be easy to use.
5. **HCL AppScan**: Offers IAST capabilities as part of its comprehensive application security suite. It's designed to identify security vulnerabilities in real time as the application is being used.
6. **Checkmarx**: Known for its SAST tool, Checkmarx also offers IAST capabilities. Their solution integrates into the application and provides real-time feedback on security vulnerabilities.
7. **Tenable.io**: Offers IAST functionality as part of its web application scanning solution. Tenable.io focuses on ease of use and integration with existing development workflows.
8. **Rapid7 InsightAppSec**: Provides dynamic analysis capabilities and includes IAST features. It's designed to integrate with modern development environments and provides detailed vulnerability reports.

These IAST tools are designed to be integrated into the software development lifecycle, providing real-time analysis and feedback to developers. They help in identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities early in the development process, thus enhancing the overall security posture of applications. The choice of an IAST tool often depends on the organization's specific needs, existing infrastructure, and compatibility with its technology stack.
