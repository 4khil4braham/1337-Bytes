# ⏹️ IAST

IAST, or Interactive Application Security Testing, is a security testing methodology combining elements of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). It's designed to analyze applications from the inside out while they are running to detect vulnerabilities.

Key aspects of IAST include:

1. **Real-Time Analysis**: IAST tools perform analysis in real-time, often as part of functional testing or quality assurance processes. They monitor the application's behavior and data flow as it executes.
2. **Integration with Application Runtime**: Unlike SAST, IAST works from within the application, often using agents or sensors integrated into the runtime environment. This allows IAST to observe the application's operations and interactions with external components and systems.
3. **Detection of a Wide Range of Vulnerabilities**: IAST is effective at identifying both static and dynamic vulnerabilities, including those related to configuration issues, data flow anomalies, and unhandled exceptions.
4. **Low False Positive Rate**: Since IAST analyzes applications in their running state and understands the context of code execution, it tends to have a lower false positive rate compared to SAST.
5. **Minimal Impact on Application Performance**: IAST tools are designed to work with minimal performance overhead, making them suitable for use in development and testing environments without significantly impacting the application's functionality.
6. **Easy Integration into SDLC**: IAST can be easily integrated into the software development lifecycle (SDLC), particularly during the testing phase. This integration helps in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities early in the development process.
7. **Support for Modern Development Practices**: IAST is well-suited for Agile and DevOps practices, as it provides immediate feedback to developers and integrates seamlessly into continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
8. **Complementary to SAST and DAST**: IAST is often used with SAST and DAST methodologies to provide a comprehensive view of an application's security posture.

IAST represents an advanced approach to application security testing, providing the benefits of static and dynamic analysis while an application is in use. This makes it a valuable tool for organizations looking to enhance their application security without disrupting their development processes.
